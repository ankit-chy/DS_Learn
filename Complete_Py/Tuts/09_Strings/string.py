# String Indexing
# String indexing is used to access individual characters in a string

print(name[0])  # print the first character of name - A
print(name[1])  # print the second character of name - n
print(name[2])  # print the third character of name- k
print(name[3])  # print the fourth character of name - i
print(name[4])  # print the fifth character of name - t
print(name[5])  # print the sixth character of name - 1

print("*****************************")

# Negative Indexing
# Negative indexing is used to access individual characters in a string from the end of the string
print(name[-1])  # print the last character of name - 1
print(name[-2])  # print the second last character of name - t
print(name[-3])  # print the third last character of name - k
print(name[-4])  # print the fourth last character of name - i
print(name[-5])  # print the fifth last character of name - n
print(name[-6])  # print the sixth last character of name - A
